[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/) is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost analytics data warehouse. BigQuery is NoOps—there is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator—so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights, use familiar SQL, and take advantage of our pay-as-you-go model.

A nice feature of BigQuery is it's python interface. It uses a package called bq_helper to perform SQL queries and manipulations.

'import bq_helper'
